               <p class="details">Exercise can help prevent excess weight gain or help maintain 
                         weight loss. When you engage in physical activity, you burn calories. 
                         The more intense the activity, the more calories you burn.
                        <br>
                        Regular trips to the gym are great, but don't worry if you can't find a 
                        large chunk of time to exercise every day. Any amount of activity is better 
                        than none at all. To reap the benefits of exercise, just get more active 
                        throughout your day — take the stairs instead of the elevator or rev up your 
                        household chores. Consistency is key.

               <p class="details">Worried about heart disease? Hoping to prevent high blood 
                   pressure? No matter what your current weight is, being active boosts 
                   high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the "good" cholesterol, and it 
                   decreases unhealthy triglycerides. This one-two punch keeps your blood flowing 
                   smoothly, which decreases your risk of cardiovascular diseases.
                    <br>
                   Regular exercise helps prevent or manage many health problems and concerns, including:

                   session or brisk walk can help. Physical activity stimulates various brain chemicals that may leave 
                   you feeling happier, more relaxed and less anxious.
                    <br>
                    You may also feel better about your appearance and yourself when you exercise regularly, which 
                    can boost your confidence and improve your self-esteem

                    Exercise delivers oxygen and nutrients to your tissues and helps your cardiovascular system 
                    work more efficiently. And when your heart and lung health improve, you have more energy to 
                    tackle daily chores.

                   bedtime, or you may be too energized to go to sleep.

                    <br>
                   But there's even more to it than that. Regular physical activity may enhance arousal 
                   for women. And men who exercise regularly are less likely to have problems with erectile 
                   dysfunction than are men who don't exercise.

                     chance to unwind, enjoy the outdoors or simply engage in activities that make you happy. 
                     Physical activity can also help you connect with family or friends in a fun social setting.
                        <br>
                    So take a dance class, hit the hiking trails or join a soccer team. Find a physical 
                    activity you enjoy, and just do it. Bored? Try something new, or do something with friends or family.
